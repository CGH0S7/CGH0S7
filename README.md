# Hello there 👋 This is CGH0S7's GitHub profile

I'm an undergraduate student with a strong interest in computer architecture, high-performance computing, the Linux kernel, and the RISC-V instruction set. I love contributing to and learning from the open-source community, and I've been using Linux as my daily driver since 2019. I enjoy exploring the intersection of software and hardware, and I'm always eager to dive deeper into systems-level development.
